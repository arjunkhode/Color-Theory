# Color-Theory
Color theory for screen and print
____________

Color has three properties:

* hue 
* intensity 
* value

In simple terms, they can be named as:

* name
* purity
* value

__________

## Name
- hue

￼
### Purity
- chroma: how pure it is in relation to pure gray

￼
- saturation: degree of purity of a hue

- intensity: brightness/dullness to a hue. black or white makes a color less intense

### Value
- luminance: amount of light reflected from the hue
- shade: value we get by mixing black
- tint: value we get by mixing white

## Subtractive Color Scheme - CMYK
Starts with white, subtracts light waves
blend mode: multiply

## Additive Color Scheme - RGB
Lights come from the screen, ends with white at full intensity
blend mode: linear dodge

* Value - get by adding black or white
* Tone - get by adding grey/ reducing chroma. Useful for muting colors. In print, it is done by mixing compliments of colors

_____

## Harmonizing I

* Achromatic -  greyscale
* complimentary - Tension and stress. Use tint, shade, tone.
* Triad - 3 colors on the wheel spaced equally apart. Any 3 hues. Vibrant. Or, use one at full sat. and make other 2 less intense
* Analogous - 3 hues right next to each other on the wheel. Very similar values. Not much contrast.

## Harmonizing II

* Clashing - Choose hues of compliments. Use it with purpose.
* Monochromatic - One hue with tints and shades.
* Neutral - A hue that has been diminished by adding its compliment or black. 
* Split complimentary - Uses two colors adjacent to compliment. Contrast, but lesser.
* Rectangle - 4 colors: two pairs of compliments
* Square - 4 colors, equally spaced compliments. One dominant, other supporting.

_____

## Color temperature

- is relative.
- warmer colors are active
- cooler colors are passive
- Active colors tend to advance in space
- Passive colors recede in space

Simultaneous contrast - both hues are dominating and you can’t figure out which one is the main hue.

Warm colors can be spontaneous and welcoming, comforting

Cool colors can be soothing, calming and refreshing

Light colors suggest airiness, rest and open up the space

Darker hues close up space.
